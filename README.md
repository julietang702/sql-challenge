# sql-challenge
In this module, I acted as if I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, in which I performed research about people the company employed during the 80's and 90's, using 6 csv files. I designed and created several tables such as:
-listing the employee number, last name, first name, sex, salary
-listing the frequency counts in descending order or all employee last names
-and several more.
